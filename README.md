The program zoomify splits an image into tiles, which is useful to speed up image loading for the web. But sometimes all you have are the tiles, and no original image. This was the case for the University of Hawaii's Herbarium collection, which had thousands of plant specimen photos that were zoomified, but the original whole images had been lost. This script re-constitutes the original image from the zoomified tiles. 

Script Info: this program take a folder generated by zoomify and reconstitutes the original image.
	-i: name of folder full of zoomified tiles (will have multiple subdirectories containing tiles, that's OK)
	-o: output filepath for reconstituted jpg
  -x: override default xml properties filename (not filepath, just name). Default is ImageProperties.xml
  -n: noisy mode TRUE or FALSE (default is FALSE)

Requirements: to use this script, you need rscript installed (comes with R installation), and the R packages optparse and jpeg. You will also need to add execution privilages for this file. do so in bash with
		chmod a+x de_zoomify.r

To use this script across multiple zoomified folders (each containing tiles for a separate image):
	for f in *; do
	  ./de_zoomify.r -i $f -o "$f_image.jpg";
	done
